## Emotional Scanner 
The Emotional Scanner is a methodology created by Centro Inclusivo Kuroi, my familyâ€™s specialized school for **children with
disabilities and mental health challenges**, which screens twelve areas of wellness and their risk level in middle and high school
students. 

The program allows users to scan school communities and enable early detection, reference, and interventions for mental health prevention and treatment.

## Highlights
This project shows part of my collaboration in improving this program , which includes:

*Creating mental health superheroes with the cutting-edge **DALL-E Artificial Intelligence** system. 

The system screens twelve areas of wellness and creates images from simple text descriptions, which could make the program more user friendly and suitable for students and their families. 
Also, I have included a brief description of some of the steps I have taken into transforming this proof of concept into a **one-of-a-kind mental health app**.

## Usage
By running the Jupyter Notebook , and answering the questions using a 1 to 4 scale , a diagnostic is generated and a custom SuperHero image is generated and displayed.
